What programming languages have you used?
  - Ive spent the most time in Java by far, but ive also used python, javascript, C, C++, GDscript, and some old ones like assembly and SML for classes.
Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.
  - Mostly classes and personal projects, personal projects have been comprised of games and spur of the moment ideas. Some recent things I have been
  - working on include a sort of universal PNGtuber program, and a top battling game ive been working on durring this past summer break.
What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?
  - Im not quite sure, most of my personal projects are smaller in scale and end up half completed before I switch to something else, so it might have been
  - an in class networking project or a website ive made.
What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?
  - Im not quite sure theres an area I would single out as something i'm most comfortable with, maybe working with a concept that ive already worked with,
  - and not having to research how to use it first.
What do you feel least comfortable doing?
  - Im not super comfortable with unit tests.
